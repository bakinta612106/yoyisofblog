She was rumored to be dating her co-star, Milo Manheim, after their on-screen chemistry and off-screen relationship, but they are just friends. She was also rumored to be dating Asher Angel, but nothing came out as fans hoped.</strong></p><p>Prom Pact, a new movie on Disney Plus, contains a major error that horrified the audience. <strong>Peyton Elizabeth Lee</strong> plays Mandy Yang, a senior in high school, in the streamer's most recent film. Mandy is compelled to become friends with all-star jock Graham Lansing (<strong>Blake Draper</strong>) in the movie because of her desperation to get off Harvard University's waitlist.</p><p>Peyton Elizabeth Lee's recent appearance in the show, Prom Pact has grabbed fans' attention regarding her personal life. Why not? As she is one of the most beautiful <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>actresses</strong></a>. Fans wonder if she have a boyfriend in 2023. Or is she dating her costar <strong>Milo Manheim</strong>, with whom she shares a great bond? Let us get into detail.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>relationship status</strong></a> of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Barbie Ferreira</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Hans Kim</strong></a>.</p><h2>Peyton Elizabeth Lee Doesn’t Have a Boyfriend as of 2023; Although She Was Rumored to Be Dating Milo Manheim, They Are Just Friends!</h2><p>Since there are no confirmed reports of <strong>Peyton Elizabeth Lee</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@peytonelizabethlee</a>) being in a relationship, it is possible that she is single and doesn't have a boyfriend. Similar to how there is no indication that she is currently dating anyone on her Instagram. However, she has been linked with her co-star and there are dating rumors, so let's find out if the rumors are true.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/04/peyton-elizabeth-lee-boyfriend-2023-milo-manheim.jpg alt="Peyton Elizabeth Lee and her rumored boyfriend Milo Manheim's chemistry is adored by fans." width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Peyton Elizabeth Lee and her rumored boyfriend Milo Manheim's chemistry is adored by fans.<br></strong><strong>Image Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>Fans frequently ask if Peyton Elizabeth Lee and <strong>Milo Manheim</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@milomanheim</a>) are dating. She published a photo of the star in May. Their photos spark rumors that they are dating. Fans are obsessing over whether they are dating. The stunning actress has wowed audiences with her performances in several films and television series throughout the years. Elizabeth's Disney films are her best-known works.</p><p>Fans right away started to conjecture that the two actors might be dating, but neither has acknowledged or denied anything. It's important to note that Milo and Peyton Elizabeth Lee are slated to star in several projects together, despite the absence of official confirmation. Prom Pact movie on Disney+ and the second season of Doogie Kamealoha, M.D. features feature them. The two posed together at the <a href=# rel=noopener>ZOMBIES</a> 3 premiere in July 2022, with <strong>Milo jokingly</strong> referring to Peyton as his zombie on Instagram.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/04/peyton-elizabeth-lee-boyfriend-2023-milo-manheim-2.jpg alt="Peyton Elizabeth Lee with her rumored boyfriend, Milo Manheim." width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Peyton Elizabeth Lee with her rumored boyfriend, Milo Manheim.<br></strong><strong>Image Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>Milo Manheim and Peyton Elizabeth Lee's on-screen chemistry and off-screen relationship have undoubtedly drawn the attention of their fans, even though it is still unknown whether they are dating. Many are looking forward to their next projects and hoping to work with them more frequently in the future. J-14 contacted both actors' agents for comments, but neither one responded right away.</p><p>The relationship, however, is only based on rumors. They are working together, which is rather confusing for their relationship. Therefore, it's also feasible that they are just close friends who get along well. Together, they make a cute couple. Fans enjoy watching them interact as well. Fans undoubtedly adore them as a couple.</p><p>She was rumored to be dating <strong>Asher Angel</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@asherangel</a>) as well. Asher Dov Angel and Peyton Elizabeth Lee, a.k.a. Jonah Beck and Andi Mack, have such a genuine connection, as everyone who follows <a href=# rel=noopener>Andi Mack</a> will attest. What began as Andi's major crush in Season 1 completely turned into an emotional rollercoaster for the two of them. There were many ups and downs, from Andi learning their friendship wasn't as strong as she thought it was to Jonah getting a high school girlfriend. When J-14 spoke with Asher, he told us that, in reality, he and Peyton are just as close as you might think.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2023/04/peyton-elizabeth-lee-boyfriend-2023-asher-angel.jpg alt="Peyton Elizabeth Lee with her rumored boyfriend, co-star Asher Angel." width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Peyton Elizabeth Lee with her rumored boyfriend, co-star Asher Angel.<br></strong><strong>Image Source: Celeb Mafia</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>The cast as a whole is quite tight. Though they are all in love with one another, they are not dating. Fans want to think that Andi and Jonah's on-screen crushes are also real, but regrettably, TV relationships only exist on the screen. However, one of the loveliest scenes involving the friends was when Asher performed Being Around You&nbsp;for Peyton at one of his concerts. This is the same song that Jonah performed for Andi in the show.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>However, they came out only as friends and nothing more. So there you go; they resemble friends more than they do a boyfriend and a girlfriend. Although Peyton Elizabeth Lee is single now, she will for sure find someone in the coming days, and we hope to share the news with you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGinnrGkpLtuscuisZqalam1brjEnmSbp6mbv6qxzZ1ka2hiaHw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpeyton-elizabeth-lee-boyfriend-2023.html&text=Is%20She%20Dating%20Milo%20Manheim%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpeyton-elizabeth-lee-boyfriend-2023.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpeyton-elizabeth-lee-boyfriend-2023.html&title=Is%20She%20Dating%20Milo%20Manheim%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpeyton-elizabeth-lee-boyfriend-2023.html&title=Is%20She%20Dating%20Milo%20Manheim%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpeyton-elizabeth-lee-boyfriend-2023.html&title=Is%20She%20Dating%20Milo%20Manheim%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpeyton-elizabeth-lee-boyfriend-2023.html&description=Is%20She%20Dating%20Milo%20Manheim%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jax-taylor-and-brittany-cartwright-did-not-invite-this-vanderpump-rules-star-to-their-wedding-236256.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jax Taylor And Brittany Cartwright Did Not Invite This Vanderpump Rules Star To Their Wedding">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./interview-talking-with-actor-santiago-carrera-of-chicken-girls.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Interview: Talking with Actor Santiago Carrera of Chicken Girls">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
