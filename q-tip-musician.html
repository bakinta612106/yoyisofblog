Q-Tip was conceived Jonathan William Davis in Harlem (New York City) on April 10, 1970.&nbsp;Jonathan Davis II, his father, immigrated from Montserrat, the Caribbean island. He was raised in Cleveland.&nbsp;His mother is from Alabama and an African American.&nbsp;His family moved to St. Albans in Queens when he was a little boy.&nbsp;When he was two years old, he met Phife Dawg in church.&nbsp;He began rapping at the age of nine after Phife Dawg encouraged him. Shortly before, they heard “Rapper’s Delight”, a song by The Sugarhill Gang.&nbsp;His father’s vast jazz records inspired him, and he started DJing and making pause tape beats at the age of 12.</p><p>After being rejected by many labels for their unusual sound and image, A Tribe Called Quest signed to Jive Records in 1989.&nbsp;After recording demos, the group began work on their debut album. Q-Tip was the main producer.&nbsp;Q-Tip’s album People’s Instinctive Journeys and the Paths of Rhythm was released in 1990. It established Q-Tip’s reputation as a skilled lyricist.&nbsp;Later that year, he appeared on Dee-Lite’s house single, “Groove Is In the Heart”, which was a worldwide success.</p><p>Queens duo Mobb Deep, whom Q-Tip discovered in the early 1990s, enlisted him as a mixing engineer and producer for their 1995 album The Infamous. He also contributed a verse to the song “Drink Away the Pain (Situations)”.</p><p>In 1991, A Tribe Called Quest released their second album The Low End Theory. Wanting the group to “step it up in general”, Q-Tip encouraged Phife Dawg, who had recently become diabetic, to stay with the group and increase his participation. The result was the “smoothest” rapping “of any rap record ever heard”, due to the duo’s strong chemistry. The group also garnered acclaim for Q-Tip’s jazzy minimalist production.</p><p align=justify>Afrika Baby Bam gave him “Q-Tip” as a nickname. This became his stage name.&nbsp;Q-Tip appeared on the Jungle Brothers songs “The Promo”, which was produced by him, and “Black Is Black” in 1988. He renamed his group A Tribe Called Quest after Afrika Baby Bam gave it that name.&nbsp;These songs were featured on Jungle Brothers’ debut album Straight out the Jungle.&nbsp;The two groups met De La Soul in the same year. Together, they formed the core of Native Tongues, a collective known for its Afrocentrism and positivity, as well as their eclectic sampling.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Q-Tip</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Q-Tip</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Actor</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 10</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1970</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Harlem</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>New York</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Aries</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Michele Daves</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Q-Tip ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

The song’s chorus was performed by Tupac Shakur in the film Poetic Justice, in which Q-Tip made his acting debut as Janet Jackson’s love interest. Later that year, A Tribe Called Quest released their third album Midnight Marauders, which was hailed as the group’s most complete work. Along with his “practically telepathic” lyrical interplay with Phife Dawg, the album introduced Q-Tip’s gritty style of production.</p><p align=justify>The following year, he made a guest appearance on Janet Jackson’s single “Got ’til It’s Gone” and co-produced Mariah Carey’s single “Honey”, both of which became worldwide hits. In early 1998, a fire occurred at Q-Tip’s home recording studio, completely destroying it; among the items destroyed in the blaze were his entire record collection, consisting of nearly 20,000 vinyl records, and a computer containing many unreleased songs.

Although Q-Tip was involved in the album’s production, he considered the album a “showcase” for Jay Dee, who produced both of the singles, “1nce Again” and “Stressed Out”, along with three other songs. Q-Tip also added his younger cousin Consequence as a guest rapper on six songs. Much of the album’s lyrical themes were inspired by Q-Tip’s recent conversion to Islam, however, his relationship with Phife Dawg became strained, negatively affecting their lyrical chemistry.
