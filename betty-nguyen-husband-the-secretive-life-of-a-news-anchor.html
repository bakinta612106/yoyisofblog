She has covered many important events and stories, such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Hurricane Katrina, the death of Pope John Paul II, and the Columbia disaster. She has also received several awards and recognitions for her work, such as the Legacy of Women Award, the Regional Emmy Award, and the Huffington Post’s list of the ten most stylish anchors and reporters.</p><p>However, despite her fame and success, Betty Nguyen is very private about her personal life, especially when it comes to her husband and family. She rarely talks about her marriage or reveals the name of her husband. She also keeps her social media posts mostly focused on her professional activities and causes. So, who is Betty Nguyen’s husband and what do we know about their relationship?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Betty Nguyen Married in 2014</h2><p>According to some sources, Betty Nguyen got married on July 26, 2014, in a secret ceremony at the Church of the Blessed Sacrament in Manhattan. The wedding was attended only by close family members and friends. She did not announce her marriage publicly or share any details about her husband. She only posted a picture of her wedding ring on her Instagram account with the caption “I do”.</p><p>It is not clear how and when Betty Nguyen met her husband or how long they dated before getting married. Some speculate that he might be someone from the media industry or a fellow journalist, but there is no confirmation of this. Betty Nguyen has also not revealed his name or his occupation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Betty Nguyen Suffered a Miscarriage</h2><p>Betty Nguyen and her husband wanted to start a family soon after their marriage, but they faced a tragic loss when Betty Nguyen suffered a miscarriage and lost twins. She shared this heartbreaking news on her Facebook page in 2015, saying that she was “devastated” and “heartbroken” by the loss. She also thanked her fans and followers for their support and prayers.</p><p>Betty Nguyen did not give up on her dream of becoming a mother and tried again to conceive. She was blessed with a healthy baby boy, Thomas, on December 15, 2015. She announced his birth on her social media accounts and expressed her joy and gratitude. She also posted several pictures of her son and called him her “miracle baby”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Betty Nguyen Welcomed Another Son in 2018</h2><p>Betty Nguyen and her husband expanded their family again in 2018, when they welcomed another son, Christopher, in July.

She often posts pictures and videos of her sons and their activities on her social media accounts. She also celebrates their birthdays, milestones, and achievements with her fans and followers. She calls her sons her “pride and joy” and her “reason for living”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Betty Nguyen Husband: A Mystery</h2><p>Betty Nguyen has been married for over seven years, but she has not revealed much about her husband or their relationship. She has not even shared his name or his picture with the public. She only refers to him as “my husband” or “the love of my life” on her social media posts. She also does not wear her wedding ring on air, which adds to the mystery.</p><p>Betty Nguyen’s husband seems to be very supportive and understanding of her career and her causes. He also seems to be a loving and caring father to their sons. He respects her privacy and does not interfere with her professional life. He also does not seek any attention or fame for himself.</p><p>Betty Nguyen’s husband is a mystery, but he is also a part of her life. He is her partner, her friend, and her confidant. He is her source of strength, happiness, and inspiration. He is her husband.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibkaeypr7GnpirZpiau7CyjZympmeemsS0e9KtpquxX5eytcDYZqWgramau2601KyZmqaUYsGpsYysnJyqlam2t7GMpaCfnV2ks26tjKecsKtdlruktM6rZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbetty-nguyen-husband-the-secretive-life-of-a-news-anchor.html&text=Betty%20Nguyen%20Husband%3a%20The%20Secretive%20Life%20of%20a%20News%20Anchor&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbetty-nguyen-husband-the-secretive-life-of-a-news-anchor.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbetty-nguyen-husband-the-secretive-life-of-a-news-anchor.html&title=Betty%20Nguyen%20Husband%3a%20The%20Secretive%20Life%20of%20a%20News%20Anchor" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbetty-nguyen-husband-the-secretive-life-of-a-news-anchor.html&title=Betty%20Nguyen%20Husband%3a%20The%20Secretive%20Life%20of%20a%20News%20Anchor" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbetty-nguyen-husband-the-secretive-life-of-a-news-anchor.html&title=Betty%20Nguyen%20Husband%3a%20The%20Secretive%20Life%20of%20a%20News%20Anchor" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbetty-nguyen-husband-the-secretive-life-of-a-news-anchor.html&description=Betty%20Nguyen%20Husband%3a%20The%20Secretive%20Life%20of%20a%20News%20Anchor" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./britney-spears-fiance-sam-asghari-announce-they-lost-their-miracle-baby.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Britney Spears &amp;amp; Fianc Sam Asghari Announce They Lost Their Miracle Baby">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./batman-adversary-played-by-tom-hardy-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Batman adversary played by Tom Hardy">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
