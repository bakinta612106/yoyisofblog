Romo was born on April 21, 1980, in San Diego, California, to a construction worker father and a grocery store worker mother. Despite being a California native, Romo spent his childhood in southern Wisconsin, where he acquired an unexpected love for the Green Bay Packers.&nbsp;This combination of cultural influences adds a fascinating element to Romo’s biography, piqueing the quarterback’s interest in the history that has formed him.</p><p>Antonio Ramiro Romo was a well-known American football quarterback who spent 14 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys.&nbsp;Despite being undrafted in 2003, he signed as a free agent with the Cowboys.&nbsp;Romo led the Cowboys to four playoff berths and set franchise marks for throwing touchdowns, passing yards, and games with at least 300 passing yards.&nbsp;Due to a preseason back injury, he retired following the 2016 season and is currently the main color commentator for CBS Sports’ NFL telecasts.</p><h2>Tony Romo’s Nationality And Ethnicity</h2><p><strong>Tony Romo</strong> was born on April 21, 1980, in San Diego, California, in the United States. Joan and Ramiro Jr., his parents, were proud of their son, who grew up in California with his two brothers.&nbsp;He has American nationality since he was born in America. However, if we go into his family history, we can see that he is multiracial, with Mexican-American ancestors on his father’s side.&nbsp;His father was a Mexican-American first-generation American. Ramiro Romo Sr., his grandpa, was born in Muzquiz, Coahuila, Mexico, and migrated to San Antonio as a youngster.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tony-Romo-1.jpg alt="Tony Romo" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Tony’s grandmother comes from Robstown, Texas, and went to Racine with her family when she was 12 years old, where she met Tony’s future spouse.&nbsp;Tony has a diversified heritage not just from his father’s side, but also from his mother’s side. Joan, his mother, is of German and Polish descent.&nbsp;Tony has always valued his ancestry despite having a varied upbringing.&nbsp;Tony’s grandpa told KVUE that he is always proud of who he is, alluding to his race. “He recognizes himself as Antonio Ramiro Romo. He has a large number of Hispanic admirers that are proud of him and support him not just in the United States, but also in Mexico and Colombia.”</p><h2>Tony Romo Has a Special Relationship with His Parents</h2><p><strong>Tony Romo</strong>, who was born in San Diego, California, and reared in Southern Wisconsin, comes from a family that values hard work and athletics.&nbsp;Ramiro Romo Jr. served in the Navy and worked as a carpenter, while Joan Romo worked as a shop clerk.&nbsp;Romo was engaged in athletics throughout his youth, and his father, Ramiro Romo Jr., was supportive of his son’s sporting ambitions.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tony-Romo-2.jpg alt="Tony Romo" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He also maintains a close relationship with his grandparents and attributes his success to his family’s strong work ethic.&nbsp;Romo still seeks financial advice from them, demonstrating how family values continue to affect him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKapYr%2Bwuc5mrqKjmWLEqbHRnmSiq12dsm6y0aikZp2opbmwvsRmn6KrXZrBqbrInKCtsV2Wu6V5zZqroqeelrmqwNho</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftony-romo-wiki-where-is-he-from-explore-his-ethnicity-and-nationality.html&text=Tony%20Romo%20Wiki%3a%20Where%20Is%20He%20From%3f%20Explore%20His%20Ethnicity%20And%20Nationality&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftony-romo-wiki-where-is-he-from-explore-his-ethnicity-and-nationality.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftony-romo-wiki-where-is-he-from-explore-his-ethnicity-and-nationality.html&title=Tony%20Romo%20Wiki%3a%20Where%20Is%20He%20From%3f%20Explore%20His%20Ethnicity%20And%20Nationality" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftony-romo-wiki-where-is-he-from-explore-his-ethnicity-and-nationality.html&title=Tony%20Romo%20Wiki%3a%20Where%20Is%20He%20From%3f%20Explore%20His%20Ethnicity%20And%20Nationality" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftony-romo-wiki-where-is-he-from-explore-his-ethnicity-and-nationality.html&title=Tony%20Romo%20Wiki%3a%20Where%20Is%20He%20From%3f%20Explore%20His%20Ethnicity%20And%20Nationality" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftony-romo-wiki-where-is-he-from-explore-his-ethnicity-and-nationality.html&description=Tony%20Romo%20Wiki%3a%20Where%20Is%20He%20From%3f%20Explore%20His%20Ethnicity%20And%20Nationality" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./michael-j-fox-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tracy Pollan: All About Michael J.
