The simple answer is that fiction is real because it represents reality in a way that can be understood by someone who is not an expert on the subject.</p><p>The answer to this question is not as simple as you think. There are a few factors that might influence our decision about whether fiction is real or fake.</p><p>First of all, we need to understand the definition of reality. Reality is what we observe and experience with our senses, and it’s also what we believe to be true. In other words, it’s the sum of everything that exists in the world around us. With this definition in mind, fiction can be seen as something unreal because it’s not based on reality and because it doesn’t exist in the world around us.</p><p>Secondly, there are many examples of stories that seem more realistic than others; for example Harry Potter seems more real than Alice in Wonderland because there are references to things like owls and muggles which are</p><h3><span id=I_believe_that_fiction_is_real>I believe that fiction is real.</span></h3><p>I think that fiction is real because it represents reality in a way that can be understood by someone who is not an expert on the subject.</p><p>There are many examples where fiction can represent real events and people. For example, a person might read about an event happening to someone else in a book, but then they may find out that the same thing happened to them as well. This shows how fiction and real life sometimes overlap, as you see things happening in both worlds at once!</p><p>The fact that there are emotions involved when reading about fictional characters also proves how this category of literature is based on reality: because if no one felt emotions while reading about fictional stories then why would they bother reading them?</p><h3><span id=As_I_mentioned_above_lots_of_fictional_stories_are_based_on_real_events_or_people>As I mentioned above, lots of fictional stories are based on real events or people.</span></h3><p>As I mentioned above, lots of fictional stories are based on real events or people. This is a great way for authors to share their knowledge with the world without having to do all the hard work themselves.</p><p>Take Harry Potter for example. It’s a series about a boy wizard who goes to school at Hogwarts and learns magic from his friends Hermione and Ron Weasley (among others). The author JK Rowling used her knowledge as an expert in history, language and literature to create Harry Potter’s world with wonderful detail and imagination – but did you know the story was based on actual historical events?</p><p>In fact many of us have read great books that were written by experts in their field of study – whether it be science fiction like Star Wars or historical fiction like The Diary Of Anne Frank – these authors have truly created something magical!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allglobalupdates.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Capture-71.png.webp><h3><span id=For_example_consider_the_book_and_movie_Lincoln>For example, consider the book and movie “Lincoln”.</span></h3><p>Picture yourself at a movie theater. You’re watching Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of the novel “Lincoln,” which is based on the true story of our 16th president. Lincoln is played by Daniel Day-Lewis, who won an Oscar for his performance as Abraham Lincoln in this movie.</p><p>How can one thing be based on another thing that is itself based on something else? It seems like an impossible situation—how can one thing be based on another thing that is itself based on something else?</p><p>The answer to this question lies with how we define what it means for something to be fact or fiction. In everyday language, we use words like “based on” or “inspired by” interchangeably with words like “fiction” and “non-fiction.” But in their strictest sense, these terms have very clear meanings; even though they may seem similar in everyday usage, they are not interchangeable.#ENDWRITE</p><h3><span id=It_tells_the_story_of_Abraham_Lincolns_struggle_to_pass_the_13th_Amendment_which_outlawed_slavery_in_the_USA>It tells the story of Abraham Lincoln’s struggle to pass the 13th Amendment which outlawed slavery in the USA.</span></h3><p>Abraham Lincoln is a real person and he was the president of the United States. He did pass the 13th Amendment, but it took him years to do so. In addition, Abe Lincoln didn’t pass the amendment by himself; he had help from many others including his cabinet secretary William Seward.</p><h3><span id=Its_a_fictional_representation_of_a_true_story>It’s a fictional representation of a true story.</span></h3><p>It’s a fictional representation of a true story. A good example would be the movie Titanic. It is based on the sinking of the RMS Titanic, which actually happened, but some things were changed in order to make it more entertaining and interesting.</p><p>It also includes many great fictional characters who didn’t exist in real life, such as Jack and Rose, who both have their own motivations for going on board (Jack needs work as an artist; Rose wants to be rich).</p><p>The writers use creative license so they don’t have to explain every little detail about these fictional characters’ lives on land before they boarded the ship—it would take too much time from other aspects of the plot!</p><p>In this example, there are elements that are true such as knowing what happened during those fateful days when everyone was boarding boats trying desperately not only save themselves but also rescue others through heroic acts like helping women climb into lifeboats or sacrificing themselves by staying behind so others could escape safely with them later on during each round trip mission sent out by officers aboard ship once someone realized how bad things really were getting very soon thereafter due to rising water levels inside ship itself (which caused increased pressure outside hull walls).</p><h3><span id=It_doesnt_tell_you_everything_that_happened>It doesn’t tell you everything that happened</span></h3><p>but it uses creative license to make a more entertaining story while still being accurate.</p><p>Creative license is a way of allowing authors to add things to a story that may not be true. For example, if you read about an author taking their family on vacation, they might write about the trip as if it were happening at that moment in time. But in reality, it probably happened years ago! They are using creative license when describing such events as if they were actually happening right now.</p><h3><span id=Similarly_many_great_fictional_characters_like_Harry_Potter_were_inspired_by_real_people_and_real_events>Similarly, many great fictional characters like Harry Potter were inspired by real people and real events.</span></h3><p>I think a lot of people don’t realize that many great fictional characters were actually inspired by real people and real events. Harry Potter, for example, was inspired by JK Rowling’s own childhood. In her book How the Harry Potter Books Changed the World she writes: “When I was growing up my father used to tell me stories about a secret wizarding school called Hogwarts – where only these special students could learn magic…it became an ambition of mine.”</p><p>Similarly, many other great fictional characters were also inspired by real people and real events:</p><p>The main character in Frozen was based on Disney’s own sister. The movie Finding Nemo was based on director Andrew Stanton’s experiences with his son at Disneyland. Mr Bean was originally intended as a one-off character but became so popular that he got his own TV show!</p><h3><span id=So_what_do_you_think_Is_fiction_real_or_fake>So what do you think? Is fiction real or fake?</span></h3><p>So what do you think? <a href=#>Is fiction real or fake</a>? The answer is both. Fiction is real because it represents reality in a way that can be understood by someone who is not an expert on the subject. It also uses creative license to make a more entertaining story while still being accurate.</p><p>On the other hand, fiction isn’t completely accurate in representing reality because it doesn’t tell the complete truth about what happened or give an accurate representation of what happened. Fictional narratives are often created from historical events and facts but altered for entertainment purposes.</p><h2><span id=The_simple_answer_is_fiction_is_real_because_it_represents_reality_in_a_way_that_can_be_understood_by_someone_who_is_not_an_expert_on_the_subject>The simple answer is fiction is real because it represents reality in a way that can be understood by someone who is not an expert on the subject.</span></h2><p>The simple answer is fiction is real because it represents reality in a way that can be understood by someone who is not an expert on the subject.</p><p>Fiction presents us with a condensed version of real life, where we can experience new things without actually having to go through them ourselves. It’s like watching a movie: you accept that what’s happening onscreen isn’t real, but you still feel engaged and entertained (hopefully). This kind of engagement happens when we watch fiction and allows us to learn about life through stories, which are usually based on some kind of truth.</p><p>For example: “The Crucible” by Arthur Miller was based on an historical event called the Salem Witch Trials where many people were accused of being witches and put to death. However, Miller changed certain details while writing his play so that he could create something more interesting for audiences today than simply retelling what happened in history books – but he didn’t change anything major enough that his story didn’t match up with events that really took place back then!</p><h2><span id=Conclusion>Conclusion</span></h2><p>I hope this blog post has helped you to see that fiction is real. I believe that the best way to understand reality is through storytelling because it brings us closer together and allows us to share experiences with each other.
