One of the people in the car also had two active warrants out for their arrest.</p><p>“We were like, ‘Well, this doesn’t bode well for the weekend,” Doyle said.</p><p>The disorder only seemed to snowball from there.</p><p>In one of the more bizarre incidents from the five-day bash, one attendee had his throat slit by a supposed friend during a fight.</p><p>“They were intoxicated, they got into a fight, one of them slit the other one’s throat and then fled into the park,” Doyle said.</p><p>The suspect remains at large.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000661169622.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000661169654.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000661169623.jpg><p>In another altercation, Missouri resident Lancer Hodges, 29, was accused of strangling a woman in an argument over a blanket, court records say.</p><p>The victim told police Hodges choked her until “she was losing consciousness” and couldn’t breathe.</p><p>Hodges denied choking the woman, but police noted that he woman had scratches and red marks on her neck, in addition to fingerprints behind her ears.</p><p>He was charged with strangulation, wanton endangerment, and fourth-degree domestic violence assault, according to court records.</p><p>A multitude of other revellers suffered accidental injuries too, Doyle told the Ledger.</p><p>One attendee drove a vehicle over a two- to three-inch-thick “log” that went through the bottom of his vehicle and impaled him in the abdomen.</p><p>“When it tried to come out through his back it was stopped by a steel plate in his seat,” Doyle said.</p><p>The man was transported to the hospital with the branch still lodged inside of him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000661169911.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000661169658.jpg><p>Another man lost part of his finger when his own vehicle, which was being lifted up a jack, fell and landed on his hand.</p><p>Others suffered lacerations, dislocated fingers, various broken bones, and other injuries.</p><p>Such was the chaos, Doyle said a sheriff’s deputy accompanied emergency responders into the event whenever they received a call.</p><p>“There were so many intoxicated people, we just decided, ‘If dispatch sends an ambulance in, we’re sending a deputy in with them,’” Doyle said.</p><p>Nobody died during this year’s festivities, though at least one person was killed during one of the two events in 2020.</p><p>Mammoth Cave is a tiny town roughly 60 miles from Louisville. Doyle said the 20,000-strong event overwhelmed local emergency services and has angered local residents.</p><p>“The people that live here, they don’t want this business here,” Doyle said.</p><p>“What we want are responsible businesses that add to the value of our communities. That business [Blue Holler Offroad Park’ has the capability of being that. To date, it hasn’t always added value to the community. At times, it adds stress to the community.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000661169656.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000661169572.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000661169641.jpg><p>Doyle added that he ordered all of his deputies to work mandatory overtime and requested assistance from the Kentucky State Police to help control the unruly crowd.</p><p>In total, 48 people were charged by police and 14 were arrested.</p><p>Six of the charges were felony accounts, including assault, and 30 were related to drug and alcohol offenses. Sixty-three traffic citations were also issued.</p><p>Offenders came from Kentucky and several other states, including Michigan, Indiana, Missouri and Tennessee, according to court records.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/06/NINTCHDBPICT000661169919.jpg><p>Despite the days of disorder, festival organizer Justin Stowers – otherwise known by his stage name Justin Time – celebrated the event as “the coolest thing I’ve ever seen in my life.”</p><p>“We can definitely improve on a lot of things to make the one in October run a lot better,” Stowers said in a Facebook post.</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NA-Anat-Kimchi-comp.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">HORRIFIC ATTACK</h3><p>Criminal justice student is fatally stabbed in back in random street attack</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/COMP-KS-ARIZONA-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">MYSTERY CRAFT</h3><p>UFO that entered Arizona air space ‘flew at 100mph and outran police chopper’</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/comp-sc-UFO-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">ET GO HOME</h3><p>Aliens could ‘already be here’ as UFOs ‘may be robotic probes from deep space’</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/BB-OHIO-MURDER-SUICIDE-COMP.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">FAMILY SLAYED</h3><p>‘Murder-suicide leaves four members of family including girl, 5, dead’</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/EP_PORNHUB_COMP-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">‘HORRIFIC EXPLOITATION’</h3><p>Epstein ‘victim’ suing Pornhub over abuse vids of her at 10</p><a href=# class=teaser__image-anchor-tag><img decoding=async width=150 height=96 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ad-creep-window-sleeping-copy.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h3 class="rail__item-headline t-p-color">CHILLING VIDEO</h3><p>Creep climbs through children’s bedroom window while two young girls slept</p><p>“We are listening to all your suggestions.
