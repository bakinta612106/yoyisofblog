The teens were not identified in CBS News’ investigation, and their faces were blurred out in the videos.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sauk-Village-Police-Shoots-Unarmed-Teen-600x349.jpg><p>Chilling body camera and cellphone footage obtained by the outlet shows Officer Seth Brown questioning the boy and the girl about the accusation. A woman in the neighborhood blamed the boy for breaking her window a day prior, telling Sgt. Scott Langan that they knew her nephew and that she had a photo of him, according to the report.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Trending Today:</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Georgia Man Stunned with Taser By Cops, Left with Brain Damage In Traffic Stop Over Taillight Files Lawsuit</a></strong></li></ul><ul><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>‘I Thought I Could Vote’: 69-Year-Old Florida Woman Charged with Fraud for Voting After Receiving Registration Card</strong></a></li><li><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Beauty Supply Shop Owner Caught on Camera Grabbing Black Woman By Neck Says He ‘Lost Everything’ and Will Have to Leave Town</strong></a></li></ul><p>“That ain’t got nothing to do with me,” the girl <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a> to Brown.</p><p>During the exchange, the video shows that Brown instructs the children to keep their hands out of their pockets. The boy explains that they’re in the area to meet up with friends. But the officer asks them for their name and dates of birth.</p><p>“We didn’t do nothing wrong,” the boy said.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the video, the incident intensifies when the officers tell the boy to put his hands behind his back because they are taking him into custody.</p><p>“For what?” the boy asks.</p><p>“CDP,” Langan responded, referring to criminal damage to property. The outlet noted that the teen’s attorney said he didn’t know what the acronym meant during the arrest. On top of that, both officers were reportedly not on the same accord and were telling him different things.&nbsp;</p><p>“You’re going to be charged and let go,” Langan said. The other officer, Brown, said if he kept resisting, he would “tase” him, and ultimately did seconds later, causing the boy to start running, according to CBS News.&nbsp;</p><p>Next,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Langan allegedly took out his handgun in front of him and shot the teen, striking him in the hip, the outlet reported. However, the injured boy kept running out of fear and hopped over a fence. The video shows that Langan attempted to use the Taser on him again.&nbsp;</p><p>While hiding from the officers at the scene, the boy contacted his guardian, who came to the area, per CBS News. The officers informed him that emergency first responders were on the way. The teen was transported to a local hospital for medical treatment.&nbsp;</p><p>“He was afraid they were coming after him,” one of the teen’s attorneys, Al Hofeld Jr., told the outlet. “He was afraid they were going to shoot him again.”</p><p>The eighth grader wasn’t arrested or charged. His attorneys, Hofeld Jr. and Gabe Hardy filed a lawsuit against the police department.</p><p>“They never arrest him. They never charge him. They never cite him. He never has to go to court. That was the end of, it was the end of the matter,” Hofeld Jr. added, per the outlet. “It’s like it never happened. And it looks and feels like contrition because they know… they shot him unjustifiably.”</p><p>During the investigation, as CBS News reported, Langan told officials he shot the teen accidentally because he thought he grabbed his Taser instead of his Glock — harrowingly similar to the cop who&nbsp;shot&nbsp;Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, in 2021. The teen’s attorney called his actions “reckless.”</p><p>Following the Wright incident, the Sauk Village Police Department created a policy that required officers to have their guns and Tasers on opposite sides of their holsters to avoid confusion, according to the report.</p><p>That day, Langan had his Taser in the front of his tactical vest, according to the report. He was cleared from charges last month. Police chief Malcolm White said disciplinary action has yet to be taken due to the department waiting on a decision from the Illinois State Police and Cook County’s State Attorney’s Office, per the outlet.&nbsp;Atlanta Black Star reached out to Sauk Village Police for comment on Friday.</p><p>Sauk Village is about 31 miles from Chicago.</p><p><a href=#>Read the original story here.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e5BpZmprX5e8pcWMnJimnaKWeqe7zq2YoJ1dqLWww9Jmqpqtm2LDqrjLmp6eZaCkuaqvxGamn56ZmLKzedKhpqisXZa7bsHNmqmmnZRisqqzx62fZp%2BilrGmvo4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbody-camera-footage-shows-sauk-village-police-officer-shoot-an-unarmed-eighth-grader.html&text=Didnt%20Do%20Nothing%20Wrong%3a%20Body%20Camera%20Footage%20Shows%20Sauk%20Village%20Police%20Officer%20Shoot%20An%20Unar&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbody-camera-footage-shows-sauk-village-police-officer-shoot-an-unarmed-eighth-grader.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbody-camera-footage-shows-sauk-village-police-officer-shoot-an-unarmed-eighth-grader.html&title=Didnt%20Do%20Nothing%20Wrong%3a%20Body%20Camera%20Footage%20Shows%20Sauk%20Village%20Police%20Officer%20Shoot%20An%20Unar" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbody-camera-footage-shows-sauk-village-police-officer-shoot-an-unarmed-eighth-grader.html&title=Didnt%20Do%20Nothing%20Wrong%3a%20Body%20Camera%20Footage%20Shows%20Sauk%20Village%20Police%20Officer%20Shoot%20An%20Unar" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbody-camera-footage-shows-sauk-village-police-officer-shoot-an-unarmed-eighth-grader.html&title=Didnt%20Do%20Nothing%20Wrong%3a%20Body%20Camera%20Footage%20Shows%20Sauk%20Village%20Police%20Officer%20Shoot%20An%20Unar" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbody-camera-footage-shows-sauk-village-police-officer-shoot-an-unarmed-eighth-grader.html&description=Didnt%20Do%20Nothing%20Wrong%3a%20Body%20Camera%20Footage%20Shows%20Sauk%20Village%20Police%20Officer%20Shoot%20An%20Unar" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./former-rhoa-star-phaedra-parks-opens-up-about-finding-life-after-jailbird-apollo-248927.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Former RHOA Star Phaedra Parks Opens Up About Finding Life After Jailbird Apollo">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./debbie-wasserman-schultz-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Debbie Wasserman Schultz Net Worth: A Deep Dive into the Politicians Finances">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
