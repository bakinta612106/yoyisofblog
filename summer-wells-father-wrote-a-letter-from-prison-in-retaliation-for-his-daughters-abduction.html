Don Wells, her father, has sent a letter from prison to “the person or individuals responsible” for his daughter’s abduction.&nbsp;Don Wells was caught for a separate DUI after losing his daughter and is in jailed. At the time, he was on probation. He said in a message published on the family’s Find Summer Wells website,</p><p>“You have not only shattered Summer’s heart and stolen her away from her mother and father, who adore her, but you have also wrecked her prospects of getting an education, so wrecking her life.”</p><h2>Summer Wells’ shattered father writes heartbreaking words</h2><p>According to reports, Bly told authorities that her daughter returned to their Rogersville, Tennessee, home on Ben Hill Road on June 15, 2021, after helping her grandmother plant flowers.&nbsp;The girl’s parents have said that they believe someone broke into their 11-acre property, lured her outdoors, and then kidnapped her.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Summer-Wells-3-1.jpg alt="Summer Wells" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Wells and his wife, Candus Bly, had their three other sons taken from the residence when they were unable to locate Summer Wells last July.&nbsp;According to the letter, Wells and Bly were laid off after her abduction and have had problems finding new jobs.</p><p>In addition, the letter said,</p><p>“You see, the public holds us accountable,” he wrote. “I’m not sure whether we’ll ever find work again.” Nobody wants to employ my wife, and I’ve been dismissed from my job for 13 years. We could lose everything in the end. “When you kidnapped our daughter, you took our life.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Today marks one year since Summer Wells disappeared, sparking an ongoing <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#TNAMBERAlert</a>.</p><p>Our team continues to work with other agencies to chase every lead we can.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation claimed that the investigation is still ongoing but refused to release any other details.&nbsp;Summer was around three feet tall and forty pounds when she was last seen. She was wearing a pink blouse, gray jeans, and was maybe barefoot when she disappeared.&nbsp;On June 15 and 16, a red pickup truck driver was sighted along Ben Hill Road in Rogersville. It has full-sized ladder racks and white buckets in the bed.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Summer-Wells-2.jpg alt="Summer Wells" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Summer’s disappearance is still being investigated, with detectives looking into all possibilities.&nbsp;Investigators said they have executed various search warrants and devoted thousands of man hours to the probe over the last year. The Amber Alert is still active. Furthermore, Rose Marie Bly, Bly’s sister, went missing in Wisconsin in 2009 in an unsolved case, and both of Summer’s parents have a history of criminal involvement.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Don Wells</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Summer Wells</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqrqWdmr9uw8Slo6xllpbBqbHRZq6rp6SaeqJ5y56rrZ2iYrOzu8xmp6uho6S7brXNZqmerJGhtqLAyKilZp6fp3qptdJmm5qtl53Bpr7SZpibnKWYwaq7zWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsummer-wells-father-wrote-a-letter-from-prison-in-retaliation-for-his-daughters-abduction.html&text=Summer%20Wells%20Father%20Wrote%20A%20Letter%20From%20Prison%20In%20Retaliation%20For%20His%20Daughters%20Abduction&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsummer-wells-father-wrote-a-letter-from-prison-in-retaliation-for-his-daughters-abduction.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsummer-wells-father-wrote-a-letter-from-prison-in-retaliation-for-his-daughters-abduction.html&title=Summer%20Wells%20Father%20Wrote%20A%20Letter%20From%20Prison%20In%20Retaliation%20For%20His%20Daughters%20Abduction" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsummer-wells-father-wrote-a-letter-from-prison-in-retaliation-for-his-daughters-abduction.html&title=Summer%20Wells%20Father%20Wrote%20A%20Letter%20From%20Prison%20In%20Retaliation%20For%20His%20Daughters%20Abduction" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsummer-wells-father-wrote-a-letter-from-prison-in-retaliation-for-his-daughters-abduction.html&title=Summer%20Wells%20Father%20Wrote%20A%20Letter%20From%20Prison%20In%20Retaliation%20For%20His%20Daughters%20Abduction" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsummer-wells-father-wrote-a-letter-from-prison-in-retaliation-for-his-daughters-abduction.html&description=Summer%20Wells%20Father%20Wrote%20A%20Letter%20From%20Prison%20In%20Retaliation%20For%20His%20Daughters%20Abduction" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./taylor-swifts-best-surprised-faces-2012612.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Taylor Swift's Best Surprised Faces">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./10097991-steelers-najee-harris-voices-frustration-after-browns-loss-im-tired-of-this-s-t.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Steelers' Najee Harris Voices Frustration After Browns Loss: 'I'm Tired of This S--t' | News, Scores">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
