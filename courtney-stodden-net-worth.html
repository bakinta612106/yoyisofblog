She was born on August 29, 1994 and became famous when she married a man so much older than her that he further apart in age from her than many parents are with their own children. She was born in Tacoma, Washington and raised by her parents Alex Stodden and Krista Kay Stodden. Her parents spent her entire life spoiling her and giving her everything she ever wanted. Courtney Stodden calls her childhood beautiful and fun, and she even said her parents allowed her to quit school as a teenager because the other kids were so jealous of her looks that they gave her a hard time.</p><p>She decided to home school her high school career online via a high-priced Christian Academy, where she eventually graduated. College was no on her radar, however. She wanted to be a beauty pageant queen, so she began competing. Modeling was her other dream, but she didn’t fit the mold and did not make it in that industry. She also wanted to be a pop singer but was not having any luck in that business as a teenager, despite the fact that her mother was her manager and they were all over the country looking for a record label for her.</p><p>Courtney Stodden’s rise to fame began when she was only 16. She met actor Doug Hutchinson in an online workshop for aspiring actors, another job she wanted to add to her resume, and the two began a flirtation. He said he had no idea she was a teen when he began flirting with her online. For six months, the couple fell in love online and then decided to meet. Her parents were all right with it. He claims that when he met her and realized she was a 16-year-old girl that he spoke to her parents and her mother informed her that she knew all along about their age difference and that she was all right with it. Hutchinson was 51 at the time, making him 35 years her senior.</p><p>By 2011, when she was only 16, the couple was married and living together. Her father is actually younger than her husband. The couple was married for two years before they announced that they would divorce, and then they announced a year after that they were getting back together. She was famous by this point for her age and her marriage. Marrying an actor made her national attention in the first place, but one so much older than her really made her famous. When they decided to reconcile their marriage, they entered into couples therapy on a nationally televised reality show. She gets most of her net worth from her reality show but also from appearances she’s been paid to make here and there. Her husband’s net worth does not factor into her own net worth in any way, shape or form.</p><p>Photo by Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGiaqK2iqbumxYysq6iclJq7brrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcourtney-stodden-net-worth.html&text=Courtney%20Stodden%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcourtney-stodden-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcourtney-stodden-net-worth.html&title=Courtney%20Stodden%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcourtney-stodden-net-worth.html&title=Courtney%20Stodden%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcourtney-stodden-net-worth.html&title=Courtney%20Stodden%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcourtney-stodden-net-worth.html&description=Courtney%20Stodden%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./did-boris-johnson-got-his-hairdresser-pregnant.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Did Boris Johnson Got His Hairdresser Pregnant?
