He has not offered any information about his siblings. While still a child, his family relocated to the United States, where he was brought up.</p><p class=align-left>He took his elementary and high <a href=#>school</a> <a href=#>education</a> in the United States. He enrolled at Chaffey College before transferring to the University of California, Santa Barbara for his <a href=#>university </a>studies.</p><h3>Peter Popoff's career and ministry</h3><p class=align-left>While in the United States, his father preached at various revival meetings. In the 1960s, he started appearing as a preacher alongside his father. He was recognized as The Miracle Boy Evangelist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/d16d68cc43a3d5d1.jpg><p class=align-left>He began his television ministry in the early 1980s, with the miraculous healing of chronic and incurable diseases being the central attraction of his sermons. Eventually, it was discovered that all the people he claimed to heal were dramatists who had been trained to add more weight to his miraculous deeds.</p><p class=align-left>Rev Peter Popoff gained fame for announcing home addresses and the specific illness of his audience with high precision. However, he was exposed by magician and sceptic James Randi and his associate Steve Shaw. It was revealed that his wife was using a wireless radio transmitter to broadcast information to him. In addition, Peter Popoff's prayer request card contained information about his audience.</p><p class=align-left>After the exposure on <i>The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson</i> and on the <i>NOVA </i>episode, his ministry's reviewer rating and donating started to drop significantly. In September 1997, he declared bankruptcy, listing over 790 unpaid creditors.</p><p class=align-left>In 1998, he was making a comeback with his target audience being African-Americans. However, in 2008 the United Kingdom regulator Ofcom issued a warning to all the broadcasters transmitting his material.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, this did not stop him from continuing his ministry. In return, this led to the emergence of Peter Popoff's commercial. In 2009, he started running advertisements to offer free crosses that contained blessed water and holy sand. Peter Popoff's water was alleged to spare people from radiation sickness.</p><p class=align-left>In the mid-2000s, Peter Popoff's water commercial was run on late-night infomercials in the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Until 2006, Peter Popoff's ministries functioned as a profit-making organization. Then, it merged with a small <a href=#>church</a> in Farmers Branch, Texas. Thus it was no longer obliged to report annual income or salary to the IRS.</p><h3>Wife and children</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/4b7e1cccd610b5fc.jpg><p class=align-left>The pastor is married to Elizabeth in August 1971 and settled in Upland, California. The couple has been blessed with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">three children</a>, Amy Cardiff, Nickolas, and Alexander.</p><h3>Peter Popoff's net worth</h3><p class=align-left>The German American televangelist has an estimated net worth of<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> $10 million </a>as of 2021.
