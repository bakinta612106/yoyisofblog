Her family moved to the United States when she was five years old, which explains why she holds Italian and American citizenships. Flo was raised alongside one known brother, and his name is Viktor.</p><p class=align-left>She was born into the family of a housewife mother. On the other hand, her father (Robert) was a photo editor and bureau chief for an Italian-based newspaper.</p><p class=align-left>The family settled on the Upper East Side, New York City. She <a href=#>started schooling</a> at Ethical Culture Fieldston School. Later, she graduated from Vassar College.</p><h3>Florinka Pesenti birthday</h3><p class=align-left>Florinka Pesenti age is 42 as of 2020. She celebrated her 42nd birthday on 17th January 2021. Considering she is a private person, she did not share anything regarding her birthday on social media.</p><h3>Career progress</h3><p class=align-left>Like any other successful person, Pesenti started way below before she became the prosperous and highly respected person she is today. According to Florinka Pesenti LinkedIn profile, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">her career began</a> in 2002 at <i>Glamour Magazine</i>. She worked as a public relations associate for the magazine for three years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/2f082e3d9e13c0c8.jpg><p class=align-left>In January 2005, she landed another opportunity at <i>TOD'S Group</i>. The firm deals in luxury goods, such as shoes and other leather products. She was a Director of Public Relations of the company for around five years.</p><p class=align-left>In January 2010, she won another big role. She was employed to represent <i>GUCCI</i> as the Director of <a href=#>Public Relations.</a> She served in the position until January 2016. She, undoubtedly, gained substantial experience working for the giant fashion luxury brand.</p><p class=align-left>In January 2016, Pesenti became the Vice President Global Communications of <i>Ralph Lauren</i> – another leading global Apparel & Fashion company. She worked for the New York-based company for roughly three years before stepping down in July 2018.</p><p class=align-left>She became the Vice President of <i>MacAndrews & Forbes</i> immediately after leaving the same job position at <i>Ralph Lauren</i>. It is now two years and seven months since she assumed the office of the <a href=#>Vice President</a> in the American holding firm.</p><h4><strong>The Amazing Race</strong></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/f6e6096fcaf41eaa.png><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Amazing Race</a> is a reality television show that has been airing on CBS since 2001. The show features contestants (in a pair of two) who compete against each other for the grand prize of $1 million.</p><p class=align-left>Contestants are subjected to various mental and physical activities, and they can only proceed to the next level when they complete their tasks. The first team to arrive at the destination wins while the farthest team behind is eliminated.</p><p class=align-left>In 2002, Florinka took part in the competition. She teamed up with Zach, whose real name is Zachary Golden Behr. Fortunately, the pair emerged winners of The Amazing Race 3 (season three), taking home $1 million. Florinka Pesenti <i>Amazing Race</i> participation saw her become the first woman to win in the show.</p><p class=align-left>Sadly, she declined to take part in the All-Stars season. This was after Zach was excluded from the list of contestants. Also, she cited that the show brought out the worst in her, something she did not want to repeat.</p><p class=align-left>Are Flo and Zach still together? No. They were teammates, meaning they were not romantically involved. Zach is now married to a lady by the name Elyse Steinberg. On the other hand, Flo is romantically involved with Dan Abrams. Flo and Zach are only friends from college days.</p><h3>Marital status</h3><p class=align-left>Is Florinka Pesenti married? She has been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">together with Dan Abrams</a>, a host and Chief Legal correspondent at ABC News. The two started dating in 2009, and their relationship is going stronger by the day. However, they are yet officially to marry through a wedding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/47a59c87ece87e0c.jpg><p class=align-left>Adam has never come public about his marital status. Likewise, the former <i>Gucci</i> Director of Public Relations has remained silent about the issue for a long time. Even so, the two have a child together – a son whose name is Everett Floyd Abrams.</p><p class=align-left>Interestingly, Florinka Pesenti son is named after Dan Abram’s father (Everett Floyd Abrams). She was born in 2012, meaning he is presumably 9 years old now.</p><h3>How wealthy is Flo Pesenti?</h3><p class=align-left>She is among the wealthiest people in the US. She has held <a href=#>high job positions</a> in notable companies such as <i>Gucci, Glamour Magazine, Ralph Lauren</i>, and <i>MacAndrews & Forbes</i>. Based on the reputations of the companies, she has made a good fortune over the years.</p><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, Florinka Pesenti net worth is still under review. Even so, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">some sources estimate</a> her net worth to be around $2 million.</p><h3>Social media presence</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/457881543ec9f1c1.jpg><p class=align-left>Florinka Pesenti Instagram page is private. Based on her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">number of followers</a>, she is not a heavy user of the platform. The same applies to her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook page</a>; most of the photos available on Facebook are those of her son.</p><p class=align-left>Indeed, Florinka Pesenti of The Amazing Race is a remarkable woman. She is a hardworking, determined, and diverse individual. Her track record speaks for itself. Flo has been winning since 2002. Over the years, the Italian-born beauty has served in reputable companies such as <i>Gucci, Ralph Lauren, </i>and <i>MacAndrews & Forbes</i>.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a id=https://briefly.co.za/93666-dustin-poirier-age-wife-record-movies-philanthropy-profiles-net-worth.html href=#>Dustin Poirier age, wife, record, movies, philanthropy, profiles, net worth</a></p><p class=align-left><a href=# title>We</a> recently shared a detailed article about the biography of <a href=#>Dustin Poirier</a>.
