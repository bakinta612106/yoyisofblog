However, despite their greatest efforts, there’s no denying that having wealthy roots has certainly helped them along the way. Here are 10 celebrities who were rich before being famous.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/186606080.jpg alt='Nylon Magazine Celebrates "America The Issue" With Lana Del Rey And Marvin Scott-Jarrett' width=641 height=454 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>10. Lana Del Rey</strong></p><p>Elizabeth Grant, better-known by her stage name Lana Del Rey, is the daughter of former Grey Global Group account executive, Patricia Ann Hill, and account executive turned entrepreneur Robert Grant Jr. With two wealthy parents, Del Rey is certainly no stranger to living the high life; however, with a successful music career, she has been able to build a fortune of her own.</p><p>(Photo by Jason Kempin/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/451794411.jpg alt="2013 American Music Awards - Arrivals" width=638 height=424 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>9. Nicole Richie</strong></p><p>Before Nicole Richie became famous for being Paris Hilton’s bestie, she certainly wasn’t struggling to get by. &nbsp;As the adopted daughter of Grammy Award-winning musician, Lionel Richie, Nicole definitely wasn’t hurting for money before she rose to reality TV fame. &nbsp;Throughout his more than 40 year career, Lionel Richie has sold more than 100 million records, making him one of the best-selling musicians of all-time.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/455404890.jpg alt="Baltimore's Fort McHenry Celebrates 200th Anniversary of Star-Spangled Banner" width=638 height=424 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>8. Jordin Sparks</strong></p><p>Jordin Sparks rose to fame in 2007 when she was announced as the winner for the sixth season of Fox’s competitive singing show, American Idol. &nbsp;However, even without American Idol, chances are the world would have eventually heard of Sparks, whose father is former NFL cornerback, Phillippi Sparks. As a child, Sparks was raised in a New Jersey suburb and was even allowed to be homeschooled so that she could dedicate more of her time to singing.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Mark Makela/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/457633446.jpg alt='"Charles James: Beyond Fashion" Costume Institute Gala - Candids' width=635 height=453 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>7.&nbsp;Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal</strong></p><p>Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal are one of Hollywood’s famous pair of siblings. &nbsp;Although they have both earned substantial wealth throughout their careers, the two were actually very well-off long before either landed their first gig. &nbsp;Their parents, Stephen Gyllenhaal, a director, and Naomi Foner a screenwriter,&nbsp;have achieved great success in the entertainment industry, and have shared their wealth with their children.</p><p>(Photo by Andrew H.

Since gaining fame, Jones has proven that her talents extend far beyond the front of a camera.&nbsp;Over the course of her career, Jones has worked hard to establish her own career to avoid living in the shadow of her famous father, Quincy Jones’ success. &nbsp;With a record number of Grammy nominations (79) Quincy Jones is one of the most successful people in recent music history, and as a result has built a multi-million dollar empire.</p><p>(Photo by Frederick M.

Armie Hammer</strong></p><p>Armie Hammer is currently working towards a career that could eventually make him one of Hollywood’s most talked about celebrities. However, even before the game, Hammer was part of a successful family that had achieved fame in its own right. &nbsp;Hammer’s great-grandfather, Armand Hammer, was a successful business man who built a fortune during the late 1950s. &nbsp;Hammer’s father and uncle have since continued the tradition of excellence by continuing to grow the family’s fortune.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Atsushi Tomura/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/461758531.jpg alt="CNN Worldwide All-Star 2014 Winter TCA Party" width=635 height=448 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>2.Anderson Cooper</strong></p><p>TV journalist and talk show host, Anderson Cooper comes from a long line of wealth. &nbsp;Cooper’s mother, Gloria Vanderbilt become the heiress of a $5 million trust fund at just 18 months-old after the passing of her father, railroad tycoon Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt. &nbsp;Cooper’s father Wyatt Emory Cooper also amassed wealth as an author and screenwriter.</p><p>(Photo by Angela Weiss/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/461363842.jpg alt="72nd Annual Golden Globe Awards - Arrivals" width=638 height=424 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;Julia Louis-Dreyfus</strong></p><p>Julia Lous-Dreyfus is an award-winning actress who was once one of the stars of one of TV’s most popular shows, Seinfeld. &nbsp;However, even though she has earned millions of dollars throughout her career, Louis-Dreyfus’ personal wealth is nothing compared to the family of wealth she was born into.
