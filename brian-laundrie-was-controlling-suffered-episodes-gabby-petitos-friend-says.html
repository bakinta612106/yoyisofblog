But you could tell he’s a little off, a little weird. Like, he’d set up our hammocks when we’d go to the beach, but wouldn’t sit with us, which I found bizarre,” she told the Daily Mail.</p><p>“Brian has a jealousy issue,” Rose said. “I’m her only friend in Florida to my knowledge and that’s not because she can’t make friends, he just didn’t want her to have friends.”</p><p>“He was always worried she was going to leave him,” she said. “It was a constant thing to try to get us to stop hanging out.”</p><p>Davis told the Daily Mail that she’d last spoken to Petito in early August, where they <a href=#>discussed meeting up in Yellowstone National Park</a> in Wyoming for Davis’ birthday on Aug. 29. Davis said that she had requested off work for the days, but never went after never hearing back from Petito.</p><p>She said that the couple never fought in front of her, however she believed that she could tell when they had just had an argument. She said that within the first year of knowing her, Petito spent between seven and 10 nights at her house after they had fought.</p><p>“I do believe that their relationship as they kept going on was getting more problematic. It just seemed like there was more and more arguments,” she told the Daily Mail, adding that they had still planned on getting married despite Petito telling her mother it was called off.</p><p>“Everything she did, I feel like he thought was wrong.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/gabby-petitos-friend-speaks-304.jpg><p><a href=#>Bodycam footage of the couple fighting</a> in Utah shows Petito inconsolably crying next to Laundrie.</p><p>“For her anxiety to act up like that, there has to be a decent thing to trigger it,” Davis said, adding that she was aware Petito suffered from anxiety. She said she wished that Petito had decided to call her after that incident.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/gabby-petitos-friend-speaks-302.jpg><p>“I’m a little upset she didn’t just call me after that fight, because she would have before,” Davis said.</p><p>Petito has not been seen since Aug. 30, when she was traversing the country with Laundrie.</p><p>Petito was reported missing on Sept. 11 after going more than a week without contacting her family.</p><p>Laundrie returned alone in her van to the Florida home they shared on Sept. 1 and is now missing.</p><p>Davis said she spoke with North Port Police on Tuesday to give them all of the information she said. She’s considered reaching out to Laundrie.</p><p>“I wanted to stand outside his house and to just beg him to tell me where he last saw her, but I know he won’t and I can’t force him to talk to me,” she told the Mail while crying.</p><p>“For all we know, he’s scared and handling this all wrong. I just wish he would talk. Just give me three words, the name of a park. Give me something, something.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnkqe2orqMpZiuppSntqZ51pqqZpufo8Gzu8uloKefXajCp7LEq5ydZZWltrS7w56qZp%2BRl6%2B6ec%2Beq6Ksn6h6p77InqWdZaOWxrR7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbrian-laundrie-was-controlling-suffered-episodes-gabby-petitos-friend-says.html&text=Brian%20Laundrie%20was%20controlling%2c%20suffered%20episodes%2c%20Gabby%20Petitos%20friend%20says&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrian-laundrie-was-controlling-suffered-episodes-gabby-petitos-friend-says.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrian-laundrie-was-controlling-suffered-episodes-gabby-petitos-friend-says.html&title=Brian%20Laundrie%20was%20controlling%2c%20suffered%20episodes%2c%20Gabby%20Petitos%20friend%20says" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbrian-laundrie-was-controlling-suffered-episodes-gabby-petitos-friend-says.html&title=Brian%20Laundrie%20was%20controlling%2c%20suffered%20episodes%2c%20Gabby%20Petitos%20friend%20says" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbrian-laundrie-was-controlling-suffered-episodes-gabby-petitos-friend-says.html&title=Brian%20Laundrie%20was%20controlling%2c%20suffered%20episodes%2c%20Gabby%20Petitos%20friend%20says" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrian-laundrie-was-controlling-suffered-episodes-gabby-petitos-friend-says.html&description=Brian%20Laundrie%20was%20controlling%2c%20suffered%20episodes%2c%20Gabby%20Petitos%20friend%20says" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./caelynn-miller-reveals-how-relationship-with-dean-unglert-has-changed-her-for-the-better-330419.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Caelynn Miller Reveals How Relationship With Dean Unglert Has Changed Her For The Better">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./beyonce-remembers-etta-james-donto-james-recalls-her-last-moments.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Beyonce Remembers Etta James; Donto James Recalls Her Last Moments">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
