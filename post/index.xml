How could you keep the IP alive if Dexter is put in prison, or worse, executed? So extreme kudos must be given to showrunner Clyde Phillips and Showtime for “Sins of the Father,” an episode that at once shows Dexter for who he is and holds him accountable, asks fans to reconsider their devotion to the central character, and overall is just a gripping, well-executed hour of television.</description></item><item><title>Dianne Feinstein Cause of Death Explore: How Did She Die?
