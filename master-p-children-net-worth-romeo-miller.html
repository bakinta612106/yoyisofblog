But how do the children of Master P measure up?</p><p>While not a billionaire like Kanye West and Dr. Dre, the No Limit Records founder Master P&nbsp;<a href=#>has a tidy net worth of $200 million.</a>&nbsp;And that net worth comes from more than just music. He set out to create a Black-owned&nbsp;<a href=#>super-car company</a>. He’s even planning on&nbsp;<a href=#>owning an Historically Black College and University (HBCU)</a>&nbsp;in the near future.</p><p>The children of Master P, too, are doing pretty well for themselves. Certainly, their father isn’t shy about sharing wealth. Romeo Miller is frequently involved in his father’s business deals. And just recently, AfroTech reported that&nbsp;<a href=#>Hercy Miller</a> also secured his $2 million bag with the help of his father.</p><p>While Master P’s children were most likely raised without having to want for anything, none of them are content with coasting by on their father’s success. And, in an interview, Master P made clear that he was all about teaching his children how to survive on their own.</p><p>“You have to teach them economics and banking at a young age,” he said, <a href=#>according to Black Enterprise.</a> “I teach them integrity and I teach them how to be hungry. If you want to be successful, it’s not about what I’ve done, it’s going to be about what you do with your career.”</p><p>Let’s take a look at how those money lessons paid off for them.</p><p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Editorial Note: Each net worth reported in this piece is a speculative estimate from an online source.</i></p><h3>Romeo Miller: Net Worth</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cms.afrotech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/RomeoMiller_Jeff-Kravitz.jpg><p>Romeo Miller, the oldest of Master P’s children, was born on Aug. 19, 1989. That makes him 32-years-old as of this writing. Although he got his start in music (under the name Lil’ Romeo) he’s now better known for his acting skills (“Madea’s Witness Protection”) and hosting duties (MTV’s “Ex on the Beach”) than he is for his music.</p><p>He’s also starred in several commercials, including this one for ICDC.</p><p></p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Celebrity Net Worth,</a> Romeo Miller has a net worth of $5 million.</p><h3>Cymphonique Miller: Net Worth</h3><p>A professional actress, model, and rapper who has more than made a name for herself outside of the family name, Cymphonique Miller — who just goes by Cymphonique, professionally — has starred in Nickelodeon shows and blockbuster movies, and is arguably the most talented of the “next generation” of Millers in the entertainment industry.</p><p></p><p>According to sources, Cymphonique reportedly has a <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth of about $2 million.</a></p><h3>Vercy Miller aka Young V: Net Worth</h3><p>For a brief period of time, Vercy Miller tried to make a name for himself as a rapper. Known as Young V, Vercy Miller’s best-known song was, perhaps, his appearance on his father’s hit “NASCAR.”</p><p></p><p>Vercy Miller also made a name for himself as a sometime actor. It’s estimated that Vercy has a net worth of between <a href=# rel=noopener>$1 million and $5 million,</a> according to sources.</p><h3>Itali Miller: Net Worth</h3><h3>Veno Miller: Net Worth</h3><p>Veno Miller is not the biological son of Master P and his ex-wife, Sonya, but he was adopted by the family when his biological father — Master P’s brother, Kevin — was killed during a robbery gone wrong. We saw him on the reality show, “Master P’s Family Empire<span>,” but he’s kept a low profile since then. He’s estimated to have a net worth of between </span><a href=#>$1 million and $5 million.</a></p><h3>Inty Miller: Net Worth</h3><p>Inty Miller has joined the family business of music and bills herself as a rapper and independent artist. She goes by the name “Princess Inty.”</p><p>She has an estimated&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>net worth of $500,000.</a></p><h3>Mercy Miller: Net Worth</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cms.afrotech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MercyMiller_Jason-Kempin.jpg><p>In July 2021, Master P made headlines when he sat courtside with LeBron James to watch their sons — Bronny and Hercy — play basketball. According to <a href=#>Atlanta Black Star,</a> Mercy, like Hercy, plays basketball. And his father bonded with LeBron at the Nike Elite Basketball League AAU hoops showcase in South Carolina, which brings together some of the top high school basketball talent in the nation.</p><p>We’ll see what Mercy’s net worth is when he’s old enough to strike out on his own.</p><h3>Hercy Miller: Net Worth</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cms.afrotech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/HercyMiller_Frederick-M.-Brown.jpg><p>Much ado has been made about Hercy Miller <a href=#>securing a $2M bag,</a> thanks to signing an endorsement deal while playing NCAA basketball for Tennessee State University.</p><p>“I signed a deal with an American technology company. Like my dad said, it’s a blessing,” Miller said to <a href=#>TMZ Sports.</a> “I learned from my dad, I’m gonna start off by giving back to the community and everyone around me. I have a camp on July 21. [And] I’m giving back to the kids. Giving school supplies.”</p><p>Hercy’s net worth is estimated to be between <a href=# rel=noopener>$1 million and $5 million.</a></p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cms.afrotech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DSC_9778-scaled-e1645329722524.jpg height=68 width=68 alt="Bernadette Giacomazzo" title="Bernadette Giacomazzo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><a href=# class="inline-block mb-4 text-h2-mobile transition-colors lg:text-h4 hover:text-main-green"><span>Bernadette Giacomazzo</span></a><p class="font-roboto text-p2-mobile lg:text-p3"><span class="line-clamp-2 lg:line-clamp-3">Bernadette Giacomazzo is the SEO Manager at Blavity, Inc.
