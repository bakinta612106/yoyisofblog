He used to work for the Kansas City Chiefs as the <a href=#>offensive</a> quality control coach. NBC Sports says that it was his first job for the NFL. He then went on to coach for the San Diego Chargers and was the wide receivers coach for the Los Angeles Chargers. Before he became the head coach of the Eagles in 2021, he was the offensive coordinator for the Indianapolis Colts.</p><p>The Kansas City Star says that Andy Reid, the current head coach of the Chiefs, fired Sirianni. It was said that when Reid became head coach, he traveled with his own staff, and Sirianni’s job was already expected to be filled by someone else. According to the Eagles’ website, the head coach for the Chiefs used to be the head coach for the Eagles.</p><p>But now that Sirianni is a successful head coach, Reid’s decision to let him go doesn’t bother him at all. “Andy came because we weren’t good enough in Kansas City. And he took over and did an amazing job, “ESPN, he said. “He said nice things. He knew I would be sad, so when I was sad, he gave me strength. I liked that, and it sounds like that’s the kind of person he is and the kind of coach he is.” But Sirianni still loves Kansas City for one reason: that’s where he met his wife.</p><h3>Nick Sirianni and Brett Ashley Cantwell met in Kansas City</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nick-sirianni-and-brett-ashley-cantwell-met-in-kansas-city-1676062901.jpg alt="nick sirianni wife brett,nick sirianni wife instagram,nick sirianni wife age,eagles coach nick sirianni wife,nick sirianni wife,nick wife,nick sirianni net worth,nick kilhams wife,nick valensi wife,nick varano wife,nick sirianni salary" width=780 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Nick Sirianni is the head coach of a football team that is getting ready for the Super Bowl. He is also a devoted husband to Brett Ashley Cantwell. Sportskeeda says that Cantwell used to teach in Kansas City, which is where she met the Eagles’ current head coach. Later, when they had to move to California, she quit her job and focused on raising their three kids. Canwell doesn’t have any public social media, so it seems like she’d rather not be in the <a href=#>spotlight</a>.</p><p>“When we first met, you showed me your Chiefs card,” Cantwell told The Athletic. Then Sirianni replied: “Hey, it did work! I would do anything to get my wife.”</p><p>According to the Indianapolis Colts’ website, the two lived in the same apartment complex. Cantwell didn’t pay much attention to her future husband when they crossed paths, but her sister persuaded her to go on a date with him. But marrying someone in the NFL was hard, especially when Sirianni had to move for his new job. She said, “I loved my job and everything about Kansas City.” “I loved Nick more. So, everything was worth it.” She still seems to feel the same way, since she and he were able to start a family together.</p><h3>Nick Sirianni and Brett Ashley Cantwell are taking a stroll down memory lane</h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nick-sirianni-and-brett-ashley-cantwell-are-taking-a-stroll-down-memory-lane-1676062901.jpg alt="nick sirianni wife brett,nick sirianni wife instagram,nick sirianni wife age,eagles coach nick sirianni wife,nick sirianni wife,nick wife,nick sirianni net worth,nick kilhams wife,nick valensi wife,nick varano wife,nick sirianni salary" width=780 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Nick Sirianni and Brett Ashley Cantwell has three children: Miles, Jacob, and Taylor. They like to go to press conferences with their dad, where they usually steal the show. In one interview, Taylor makes fun of her dad while he talks, and in another, she makes her little brother laugh, which makes Sirianni act like a dad for a while.</p><p>One might think that it’s hard for the wives of football coaches to get along, especially if, like Cantwell, they’ve never done anything related to football in their past lives. But it doesn’t look like that’s the case. Sirianni told the Indianapolis Colts’ website that everyone was in the same situation because they had to move to different cities. “There are a lot of other coaches’ wives who have kids, so that’s an instant link.”</p><p>And as Sirianni gets ready to call plays in the Philadelphia Eagles’ biggest game of the 2022-2023 season, he’s thankful for the team he’ll be playing. “That’s where I met my wife,” he told CBS News. “Because of that, I’ll always have a soft spot in my heart for that city.”</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="nick sirianni wife brett,nick sirianni wife instagram,nick sirianni wife age,eagles coach nick sirianni wife,nick sirianni wife,nick wife,nick sirianni net worth,nick kilhams wife,nick valensi wife,nick varano wife,nick sirianni salary" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
