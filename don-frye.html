Just one month later, Frye entered the UFC’s Ultimate Ultimate 96 tournament, held to find the best of the best from past tournament winners and runners up. He firstly went for the second time against Gary Goodridge, who revealed his improvement by brawling on the clinch before taking Frye down and landing headbutts, but the result was the same, as Goodridge tapped out as soon as Frye got dominant position. Don went to face Mark Hall for the third time in his career, but this fight was even shorter, with Frye getting a takedown and an Achilles lock for the give up in 20 seconds. In the finals, Frye faced feared striker Tank Abbott, who landed early devastating shots, opening a cut on Frye’s face and causing swelling. However, Abbott lost his balance and fell, allowing Frye to secure a rear naked choke, to take the title of Ultimate Ultimate 96 Champion, his second UFC Tournament Championship.</p><h2>Don Frye Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Don Frye is one of the <strong>richest MMA Fighter</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Don Frye</b>'s net worth <strong>$2 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>It played as an NCAA Division I wrestler at Oklahoma State University.</p><p align=justify>He was defeated in his final professional fight while trying to take home an event called the Gladiator Challenge Light Heavyweight Championship on the 11th of December, 2001.</p><p align=justify>Donald Frye (born November 23, 1965) is an American former mixed martial artist, amateur wrestler, professional wrestler and actor. In MMA he was one of the sport’s earliest well-rounded fighters and he had instant success, winning the UFC 8 and Ultimate Ultimate 96 tournaments and finishing as runner-up UFC 10 in his first year of competition. Despite his accomplishments, he retired from MMA in 1997 to pursue a career in professional wrestling with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and quickly became one of the company’s leading heels. After spending four years as one of Japan’s top gaijin wrestlers, Frye returned to MMA with the Pride Fighting Championships in September 2001, much more muscle-bound and sporting an American patriot persona in response to the September 11 attacks. After developing a reputation for toughness and fighting spirit, mostly due to his legendary bouts with Ken Shamrock and Yoshihiro Takayama during his two-year stint in Pride, Frye departed the promotion to compete in K-1 and Hero’s in 2004 but returned for the final Pride event in 2007. Frye was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame in 2016.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$2 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>MMA Fighter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>At UFC 10 in Birmingham, Alabama on July 12, 1996, Frye returned to tournament format. He defeated Mark Hall by stoppage, slamming the Moo Yea Do specialist and working his side with body punches until the stoppage, and then eliminated Brian Johnston, again leading the action to the mat and landing elbows to the head. However, at the finals of the event, Frye faced his toughest challenge yet, Mark Coleman, who was considered the “godfather” of the ground and pound strategy Frye often followed. Coleman, a more decorated wrestling champion than Frye himself, kept the top position through the match and landed multiple strikes to the face. Frye capitalized on a failed neck crank attempt to get standing and try to outmatch Coleman there, but he was taken down again, and a late takedown attempt of his own also failed, with Coleman reversing and threatening with an overhead throw before returning to his routine. At the end, after Coleman secured side mount and dropped punches and headbutts onto Frye’s face, the referee stopped the action, handing Frye his first loss in seven fights.</p><p>Instantly a fan favorite in the UFC, Frye returned at UFC 9 in Detroit, Michigan on May 19, 1996 to take on a match with fellow tournament winner Marco Ruas, but his opponent got injured and was replaced by Brazilian jiu-jitsu stylist Amaury Bitetti. Frye completely dominated the bout, using his wrestling expertise to stop his opponent’s takedowns and land punches, knees and elbows with freedom. He even allowed himself to try a judo ude-garami on the jiu-jitsu champion, something that was unheard at the time. At the end, after an especially hard series of strikes to the spine and head of the Brazilian, the match was stopped and Frye was declared winner.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Don Frye height</b> <strong>6 ft 1 in</strong> Don <strong>weight</strong> <strong>93 kg</strong> & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>6 ft 1 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>93 kg</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Just ten days later, in his first appearance in the United States since 1996, Don Frye took on Ruben Villarreal in King of the Cage: Predator in Globe, Arizona. After three rounds of what many considered to be a lackluster fight, the bout was ruled a draw.</p><p align=justify>After leaving the UFC, Frye went into professional wrestling and was trained by Brad Rheingans and Curt Hennig. He debuted for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) in August 1997, defeating Kazuyuki Fujita in his first match. By 1998, Frye began to rise in the ranks as he quickly became one of the company’s lead heels. On April 4, 1998, Frye won the Antonio Final Opponent tournament and earned the right to wrestle NJPW founder and wrestling legend Antonio Inoki in his retirement match, which took place later that night. Frye lost that fight. After a brief feud with Kensuke Sasaki at the end of that year, Frye joined Masahiro Chono’s new stable, Team 2000, in early 1999. After joining, Frye would spend most of 1999 and early 2000 feuding with Scott Norton over the unofficial title of Gaijin Ace, took part in the G1 Tag League in 1999 with Chono, and make two challenges for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship but was unsuccessful in each attempt. He lost out to Keiji Mutoh in his first title shot in April 1999 and was defeated by Kensuke Sasaki in his second in February 2000.</p><h2>Who is Don Frye Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Don Frye</strong> married to <strong>Mollie Frye</strong>.

He soon made the jump to the burgeoning sport of mixed martial arts himself and joined the Ultimate Fighting Championship the following year. Debuting at UFC 8 in Bayamón, Puerto Rico on February 16, 1996, Frye was among the eight competitors in the openweight tournament that night and ran through the field with ease to announce himself as one of just two fighters of the era skilled in both stand-up and ground fighting, the other being Marco Ruas. In the quarter-finals, he set the record (since broken by Duane Ludwig and Jorge Masvidal ) for fastest knockout in UFC history when he felled 410-lb Thomas Ramirez in just eight seconds via punches. After a quick technical knockout of Sam Adkins in the semis, taking him down and landing hammerfists to the face for the TKO, he met with Gary Goodridge in the final, and forced the Trinidadian brawler to submit simply by gaining dominant position at the 2:14 mark, though not without landing multiple uppercuts standing and punches on the ground. This would be the first in a trilogy of fights between the pair. Due to the controversy surrounding MMA at the time, Frye was barred from both firefighting, his previous occupation in his hometown of Sierra Vista, Arizona, and from training in the Buena High School gym he had used since his ASU days following the event.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Don Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular MMA Fighter</strong>.

The latest one is a television ad for a yakisoba product named “UFO” produced by Nissin Foods (an executive officer was a fierce fan of Frye). His significant popularity in Japan in the 2000s might be attributed to his “good old tough fuddy-duddy” character reminiscent of sheriffs in some 1960s American movies.</p><h3>Who has Don Frye lost to?</h3><table readability=2><tr>W/LFighterMethod</tr><tr><td>loss</td><td>Don Frye <b>Gary Goodridge</b></td><td>KO/TKO Kick</td></tr><tr><td>loss</td><td>Don Frye Mark Coleman</td><td>U-DEC</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>loss</td><td>Don Frye Hidehiko Yoshida</td><td>SUB Armbar</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>win</td><td>Don Frye Yoshihiro Takayama</td><td>KO/TKO Punches</td></tr></table><h3>When did Don Frye retire?</h3><p>He retired from professional MMA in 1997, deciding to pursue professional wrestling in Japan where he became one of the top gaijin heels.
